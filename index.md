# About Me

<img src="/images/mmexport1523106791576.jpg" class="floatpic" width="1080" height="1440">

My name is Yu Han. I am a senior student from the Department of Environmental Science and Engineering, Shanghai Jiaotong University. I have strong background in <b>contaminant degradation, energy storage, materials synthesis</b> and <b>water treatment.</b> In the future, I want to apply my research results for solving global energy and environment problems.

In my belief, doing research is about being creative to design an experiment or coming up a strategy to solve facing problems. That is the most fascinating thing for me.
